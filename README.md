This is an application for storing developer CVs and profile information. I named it Sammler - Sammler in German means collector.

With this application developers can post their CV and profile information and potential employers
can use this application to find developers to hire. This application will have a form for entering the following data:
a. The developers name
b. Developers skills 
c. A link to the developers github repository
d. A button to upload the developers CV.

On submission, the data are stored in the database. There will be a page in the application where potential employers can search for 
key skills, and get a listing of all developers matching those skills.

The technologies that would be deployed for this project are:
1. Python
2. Flask
3. MongoDB Database
4. HTML
5. CSS
6 .JavaScript
7. Test Driven Development
8. Travis CI
9. Virtual Environment
